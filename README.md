## Project2: Servival Analysis using COX Model

### Definition:
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women in the United States and throughout the world.
The Lungs cancer data contains 228 patients with the following variables: survival time, dead/alive status, age and ph.ecof.

### Why Survival Analysis??? 
Survival analysis lets you analyze the rates of occurrence of events over time, without assuming the rates are constant. 
Generally, survival analysis lets you model the time until an event occurs,1 or compare the time-to-event between different groups, 
or how time-to-event correlates with quantitative variables.

### Graphical Representation:

1: Plot for Age of the patient vs Time
2: Plot of Survival probability vs time for two group of people (old and young)

   
### Research Question: 

1: What is the Joint impact of Sex, Age, ph.ecog and wt.loss. on patient’s survival ?
2: What is the survival probability for Male and Female ?
3: What is the risk of death and respective hazard ratios ?
